# Upgrade Assistant

The .NET Upgrade Assistant is a tool designed to help developers upgrade their applications from .NET Framework to .NET Core. Here's a breakdown of what it does and how you can use it:

1. **Purpose** - The main purpose of the .NET Upgrade Assistant is to analyze your existing .NET Framework applications and provide guidance and automated assistance in migrating them to .NET Core. It helps identify compatibility issues, suggests replacements for deprecated APIs, and generates migration reports.

2. **Functionality** - The tool analyzes your codebase, dependencies, and configuration files to determine the feasibility of upgrading to .NET Core. It can identify potential breaking changes, API replacements, and other migration challenges. Additionally, it can automate some of the migration process by modifying your codebase where possible.

3. **Installation Options**:
    - **CLI (Command-Line Interface)** - You can install and run the .NET Upgrade Assistant from the command line. This option provides flexibility for integrating the tool into automated build processes or CI/CD pipelines. You can use commands like `dotnet tool install -g upgrade-assistant` to install it globally and then `upgrade-assistant analyze` to start the analysis process.
    - **Visual Studio Extension** - Alternatively, if you prefer a more integrated experience, there's a Visual Studio extension available. This extension allows you to perform the migration directly within the Visual Studio IDE, providing a smoother workflow for developers who are already comfortable with Visual Studio's interface. You can find and install this extension from the Visual Studio Marketplace.

4. **Usage** - Once installed, you typically start by pointing the .NET Upgrade Assistant to your existing .NET Framework project. It then analyzes your code, dependencies, and configurations, providing a report detailing the potential challenges and suggesting migration paths. Based on this analysis, you can manually address the identified issues or let the tool automate some of the changes, depending on your preferences and the complexity of your project.

In summary, the .NET Upgrade Assistant is a valuable tool for simplifying the migration process from .NET Framework to .NET Core, offering both command-line and Visual Studio integration options to suit different developer preferences and workflows.
