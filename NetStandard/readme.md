# .NET Standard Specification

.NET Standard is a specification that defines a set of APIs that all .NET implementations must support. It acts as a common ground for developers targeting multiple .NET platforms, ensuring compatibility and portability of code across different implementations like .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Xamarin. Here's how it works:

1. **Unified API**: .NET Standard provides a unified set of APIs that developers can use, regardless of the specific .NET platform they are targeting.

2. **Versioning**: .NET Standard is versioned, with each version specifying a set of APIs that are available. Higher versions include more APIs and functionalities.

3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: By adhering to the .NET Standard, developers can create libraries and applications that can run on any platform that supports that version of .NET Standard.

4. **Implementation by Platforms**: Each .NET platform (e.g., .NET Framework, .NET Core) implements the necessary APIs to comply with the specified version of .NET Standard. This ensures that applications and libraries built on .NET Standard can run on these platforms without modification.

5. **Portability Analyzer**: Visual Studio includes a Portability Analyzer tool that helps developers check the compatibility of their code with different versions of .NET Standard, making it easier to ensure cross-platform compatibility.

Overall, .NET Standard simplifies the process of developing cross-platform applications and libraries by providing a common set of APIs that work across various .NET implementations.
