# Custom Middleware in .NET Core

In modern .NET, HttpModules and HttpHandlers have been replaced with pluggable, custom middleware components. A middleware class is simply an `Invoke` or `InvokeAsync` method and access to the `HttpContext`. As part of the pipeline flow, part of the invocation includes a reference to the "next" middleware after the current one. 

## HttpModules and HttpHandlers Background

In the ASP.NET Framework, HTTP Modules and HTTP Handlers were integral parts of the request processing pipeline

- **HTTP Handlers** were classes that implemented `IHttpHandler` and were used to handle requests with a given file name or extension
- **HTTP Modules** were classes that implemented `IHttpModule` and were invoked for every request. They could short-circuit (stop further processing of) a request, add to the HTTP response, or create their own

However, in .NET Core, these concepts are no longer supported and have been replaced by **Middleware**:

- Middleware is simpler than HTTP modules and handlers
- The roles of both modules and handlers have been taken over by middleware
- Middleware is configured using code rather than in `Web.config`
- Pipeline branching in middleware allows you to send requests to specific middleware, based on not only the URL but also on request headers, query strings, etc
- Middleware is invoked in principle for every request, can short-circuit a request, and can create their own HTTP response
- The order of middleware is based on the order in which theyâ€™re inserted into the request pipeline

This transition to middleware provides a more flexible and configurable request processing pipeline, enhancing the capabilities of .NET Core applications

## Middleware Processing

The ASP.NET Core request pipeline consists of a sequence of request delegates, called one after the other. The following diagram demonstrates the concept. The thread of execution follows the black arrows.

Each delegate can perform operations before and after the next delegate. Exception-handling delegates should be called early in the pipeline, so they can catch exceptions that occur in later stages of the pipeline.

The simplest possible ASP.NET Core app sets up a single request delegate that handles all requests. This case doesn't include an actual request pipeline. Instead, a single anonymous function is called in response to every HTTP request.

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

app.Use(async (context, next) =>
{
    // Do work that can write to the Response.
    await next.Invoke();
    // Do logging or other work that doesn't write to the Response.
});

app.Run(async context =>
{
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello from 2nd delegate.");
});

app.Run();
```

## Running the Example

In this example, the request to the `/api/auth` endpoint will simply return the processed value of the "api-key" header value. 

- The `FormatRequestKeyMiddleware` middleware class will force the API key to be all lowercase
- The `ForbidTestApiKeysMiddleware` middleware class will deny test key values that start with the letters "abcd", unless the configuration value of "ForbidTestApiKeys" is false.

```shell
# run the application
dotnet run

# or, optionally, run with the ForbidTestApiKeys value as "false"
dotnet run ForbidTestApiKeys=false

# use curl to get format the API key
curl http://localhost:5282/api/auth -v -H "api-key: ABCDEFG123"
```
