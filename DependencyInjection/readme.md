# Dependency Injection

In .NET Core, dependencies are handled differently compared to .NET Framework. Previously in .NET Framework, there was no native means of handing dependency injection, having to rely on packages such as StructureMap/Lamar, MEF, Autofac, etc. Relying on 3rd party libraries always puts a project at risk due to the possibility of the project no longer receives support or updates. 

.NET Core makes dependency injection a first-class citizen and puts strong emphasis on its use to decouple dependencies within your code. The functionality still relies on the concept of a "container" and mapping instances for parent types and interfaces, and covers most scenarios well. As of .NET 8, the DI API now supports using a key/label for specifying a single instance if multiple implementations for a type are specified in the setup.

## Benefits of Using Dependency Injection (DI) in .NET

1. **Decoupling** - DI helps decouple components by allowing dependencies to be injected rather than hard-coded within classes. This promotes modularity and easier testing.

2. **Testability** - With DI, it's easier to mock dependencies during unit testing, improving the overall testability of the codebase.

3. **Flexibility** - DI enables swapping implementations of dependencies at runtime, making it easier to change behaviors or configurations without modifying the code.

4. **Scalability** - In large applications, DI helps manage complex dependency graphs more effectively, leading to better scalability and maintainability.

5. **Centralized Configuration** - DI frameworks often provide centralized configuration mechanisms, simplifying the management of application-wide settings and dependencies.

Overall, adopting dependency injection in .NET Core (and also applicable to .NET Framework with some additional setup) can lead to more modular, testable, and maintainable codebases, especially in complex and evolving software systems. The inclusion of dependency injection out of the box makes it really easy to incorporate these best practices, such as decoupling and centralized management, into your application.

## Dependency Injection Components in .NET

In .NET, `IServiceCollection` and `IServiceProvider` are fundamental components of the dependency injection (DI) system. 

`IServiceCollection` is primarily used during application startup to register services, which are typically interfaces and their corresponding implementations. These registrations define how instances of services are created and resolved throughout the application. Registrations can include scoped, transient, and singleton lifetimes, determining how instances are managed and shared.

`IServiceProvider` is responsible for resolving these registered services at runtime. It's used throughout the application to request instances of services by their corresponding interfaces. When a service is requested, the DI container provides an instance based on the registered configuration.

Together, these interfaces facilitate the practice of dependency injection, allowing developers to write loosely coupled, maintainable code by decoupling components and providing flexibility in managing dependencies. `IServiceCollection` is used for service registration, while `IServiceProvider` is used for service resolution during runtime.
